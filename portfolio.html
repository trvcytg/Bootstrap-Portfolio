                Hi! My name is Todd Tracy. I'm a 27 year old based in Chicago,
                Illinois. My background is Math and Math Education as well as
                Photography, Art, and Design.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was born on the East Coast and spent a couple of my years living
                overseas on a boat. By the time I was ten, I had visited about 25
                countries, and my family found a new home in Ohio where I lived until
                I was twenty-five. The last couple years were spent just north of
                Houston, Texas taking in the sun and heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                In my spare time I really enjoy spending time in the gym, climbing,
                and being out in the sun. I also enjoy spending time with friends,
                exploring the city, watching Netflix, Photography, and creative
                endeavors!
                </p>
