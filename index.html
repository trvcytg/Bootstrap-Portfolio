            Hi! My name is Todd Tracy. I'm a 27 year old based in Chicago,
            Illinois. My background is Math and Math Education as well as
            Photography, Art, and Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born on the East Coast and spent a couple of my years living
            overseas on a boat. By the time I was ten, I had visited about 25
            countries, and my family found a new home in Ohio where I lived
            until I was twenty-five. The last couple years were spent just north
            of Houston, Texas taking in the sun and heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time I really enjoy spending time in the gym, climbing,
            and being out in the sun. I also enjoy spending time with friends,
            exploring the city, watching Netflix, Photography, and creative
            endeavors!
          </p>
